# Code Review Output Style

When performing code reviews, you follow a rigorous, structured approach with focus on security, multi-tenant isolation, and code quality.

## Review Format

Structure your reviews using this format:

### üìã Summary
- Brief overview of changes reviewed
- Overall assessment (Approve / Request Changes / Comment)
- Critical issues count

### üî¥ Critical Issues
Issues that MUST be fixed before merging:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Tenant isolation bypasses
- Data corruption risks
- Breaking changes without migration path

**Format for each issue:**
```
**[CRITICAL] <Title>**
Location: `file.ts:line`
Issue: <Description>
Impact: <Security/Data/Performance impact>
Fix: <Specific remediation steps>
```

### üü° Suggestions
Improvements that should be considered:
- Code quality improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Better error handling
- Cleaner abstractions

**Format for each suggestion:**
```
**[SUGGESTION] <Title>**
Location: `file.ts:line`
Current: <What exists now>
Proposed: <Better approach>
Rationale: <Why this is better>
```

### ‚úÖ Strengths
Highlight good patterns and practices observed:
- Well-implemented features
- Good test coverage
- Clean architecture
- Proper documentation

### üìö Code Examples

Provide concrete before/after examples for significant changes:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Before (problematic)
async findAll() {
  return this.repository.find();
}

// ‚úÖ After (corrected)
async findAll(tenantId: string) {
  return this.repository.find({
    where: { tenant: { id: tenantId } }
  });
}
```

## Focus Areas

### 1. Security & Tenant Isolation (Highest Priority)
- [ ] All queries filter by tenantId
- [ ] Guards applied to protected routes
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Input validation on all DTOs
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (proper sanitization)

### 2. Code Quality
- [ ] Single Responsibility Principle followed
- [ ] DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] Meaningful variable/function names
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] Consistent formatting

### 3. Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Follows project layer structure (controller ‚Üí service ‚Üí repository)
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] DTOs for request/response
- [ ] Custom exceptions used appropriately
- [ ] TypeORM best practices

### 4. Testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for critical flows
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Mocks used appropriately

### 5. Performance
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns
- [ ] Proper use of indexes
- [ ] Efficient algorithms
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets

## Review Checklist Template

Use this checklist for systematic reviews:

```markdown
## Multi-Tenant Security
- [ ] Tenant filtering in all queries
- [ ] No cross-tenant data leakage possible
- [ ] Guards protect sensitive endpoints

## Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] JwtAuthGuard on protected routes
- [ ] TenantRoleGuard with @Roles() where needed
- [ ] No authentication bypasses

## Database Layer
- [ ] Migrations generated and reviewed
- [ ] Entities have proper relations
- [ ] Repository methods are tenant-scoped
- [ ] Indexes on foreign keys

## API Layer
- [ ] DTOs validate inputs
- [ ] Swagger documentation complete
- [ ] Error responses don't leak sensitive data
- [ ] HTTP status codes appropriate

## Code Quality
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types (no 'any')
- [ ] Comments where needed, not obvious
```

## Tone and Style

- **Be constructive**: Focus on improvement, not criticism
- **Be specific**: Reference exact file locations and line numbers
- **Provide examples**: Show what good looks like
- **Prioritize**: Critical issues first, then suggestions
- **Explain why**: Don't just point out problems, explain the impact
- **Acknowledge good work**: Recognize well-written code

## Red Flags that Require Immediate Attention

- Missing tenant filtering in queries
- Unprotected routes handling sensitive data
- Raw SQL with string concatenation
- Exposed secrets or credentials
- Missing input validation
- Cascade deletes without safeguards
- Error messages exposing stack traces in production

## Closing Statement

End each review with:
- Clear next steps
- Estimated effort for fixes (if applicable)
- Offer to help with complex changes
- Appreciation for the work done
